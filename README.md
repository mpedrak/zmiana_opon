# A program to check whether you should change your car's tires to summer or winter ones

## Description
The program works for any city in Poland entered by the user. It checks whether the condition, if average daily temperature is stabilized below or above 7Â°C, is met. Most manufacturers specify the time to check as 2 weeks, but the program also allows you to enter the number of days to check yourself.


## Details
The project is written in C++ using custom libraries _Curl_ and _RapidJSON_. It uses data from websites _https://geocode.maps.co_ and _https://open-meteo.com_.
